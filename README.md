# list2playlist

### This project came about from the need to migrate my Spotify playlists to YouTube.

First, I developed a basic web scraping script in the browser itself to grab the songs and save them in a string separated by '\n'. Then I saved them in a .txt file, which will be used in this project to create and save them in YouTube playlists.

And, with the help of Google Gemini and ChatGPT, we developed this project using Youtube API.
