# list2playlist

### This project came about from the need to migrate my Spotify playlists to YouTube.

First, I developed a basic web scraping script in the browser itself to grab the songs and save them in a string separated by '\n'. Then I saved them in a .txt file, which will be used in this project to create and save them in YouTube playlists.
